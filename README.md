## Planning Story
I created a blogcreate.js file to handle my class then added authenticated routes to my app.js file. When reviewing notes I decided to create blogform, footer, and layout files to import into my blogcreate.js and blogupdate files. After I was able to create a blog and set up index, I moved on to styling the landing page. Next I worked on show, update, and delete. My problem solving strategies included researching on the web on how to fix errors, reviewing materials, and asking for help.

### Unsolved Problems
When creeating a new blog I would like to redirect to the index page to show the neewly created blog. My strech goals are to see all blogs from other users and upload images.
